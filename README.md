## Overview

### Privacy Friendly App Shopping List

The Privacy Friendly App Shopping List is an Android application that does not require any permissions from the user in order to be installed. With this app users will be able to manage their shopping lists. Basically users will be able to add, edit and remove lists. A shopping list contains products which can be added, edited and removed as well.

## Motivation

Nowadays there are many apps that require many or all permissions available in Android in order to be installed. However these apps do not always need all of the permissions they ask for. With this project we want to offer an app where the user can be sure that private information such as contacts, location, identity etc., are not being used by the application.

## Versioning
