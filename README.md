## Overview

### Privacy Friendly App Shopping List

The Privacy Friendly App Shopping List is an Android application that does not require any permissions from the user in order to be installed. With this app users will be able to manage their shopping lists. Basically users will be able to add, edit and remove lists. A shopping list contains products which can be added, edited and removed as well.

## Motivation

Nowadays there are many apps that require many or all permissions available in Android in order to be installed. However these apps do not always need all of the permissions they ask for. With this project we want to offer an app where the user can be sure that private information such as contacts, location, identity etc., are not being used by the application.

## Versioning
Version 0.4 (Beta). Changes:
- Checking products onClick had been added to allow the user checking products when the floating action button ("+") was covering the checkbox by clicking on the CardView. This solution was not very intuitive because items would move to the bottom if the user accidentally clicked a product. Therefore the checkbox was added again in the ProductEditDialog. Users can check the product in this dialog if the checkbox is being covered by the floating action button ("+").
- Bug fix: product names can be repeated in different lists. The validation that avoid adding a product twice happens only inside a list.
- Bug fix: when a list is deleted all its product are deleted from the database as well
- Vertical bar of CardViews in the list overview turns grey if there are no unchecked products in the shopping list (all products checked, or list is empty)
- Responsiveness improvement: All database access operations are perform asynchronously by using the RxJava API and the RxAndroid extension

Version 0.3 (Beta). Changes:
- When edit/create dialogs (for list or products) are opened, then the keyboard is automatically showed, so the user can start typing.
- After creating a new list, the app jumps automatically inside of the new list, so the user can immediately start adding products.
- Tutorial Dialog layouts bugs fixed
- Bug fixes in Camara feature
- Share as Text feature added
- Length of List name and Product name increased to 40. If the text is too long, then "..." is showed at the end of the line
- Dynamic counter added in text fields List Name and Product Name to show the users how many characters they have left
- Product names cannot appear multiple times in the same list. Error message added so the user realizes that the product already exists
- onClick event inside a shopping list set the checkbox value to true. This feature was added because sometimes the CardView was behind the floating action button and therefore the user could not click the checkbox.
- If lists are empty, then the logo of the app and a message are shown to user. This feature was added to to fill the empty white space.

Version 0.2 (Beta). Changes:
- Statistics (total units) were added to the chart
- Statistics can be enabled or disabled for each list
- Sorting options are saved for each product list
- A reminder can be set for each list. If the notifications are enabled, then a notification pops up when the date of the reminder has been reached.
